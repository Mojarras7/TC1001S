# Project Title: Image Filtering and Text Recognition

## Overview
This project implements image filtering and text recognition using Python. It utilizes OpenCV for image processing and Tesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The main functionality includes loading an image, converting it to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur, detecting edges, and extracting text from the processed image.

## Files
- **Actividad_1_Filtrado_imagen.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for image processing and text recognition.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required Python libraries for the project.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd TC1001S
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Actividad_1_Filtrado_imagen.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells in the notebook to load an image, process it, and perform OCR.
